“Colour Memory”
The game board consists of a 4x4 grid, all in all 16 slots. All slots consists of
cards face-down. The player is to flip two of these upwards each round, trying
to find equals. If the two cards are equal, the player receives one point, and
the cards are removed from the game board. Otherwise, the player loses one
point and the cards are turned face-down again. This continues until all pairs
have been found.
